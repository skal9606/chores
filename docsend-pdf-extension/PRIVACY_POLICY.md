**Last Updated:** January 29, 2025

## Overview

Docsend to PDF is a Chrome browser extension that allows users to download Docsend presentations as PDF files.

This extension:
- Does NOT collect any personal information

## Data Access

The extension requires access to Docsend.com pages to function. When you use the extension on a Docsend presentation:

1. **Page Content**: The extension reads the current Docsend page to detect slides and extract slide images

3. **Screenshots**: If the primary method fails, the extension may capture screenshots of each slide

All data processing happens locally in your browser. No data is ever sent to external servers.

## Data Storage

The extension does not store any data persistently. All data (slide images, generated PDFs) exists only temporarily in your browser's memory during the download process.

## Permissions

The extension requests the following permissions:

- **activeTab**: To access the current Docsend tab when you click the extension
- **scripting**: To inject the slide detection script into Docsend pages
- **downloads**: To save the generated PDF to your computer
- **Host permissions for docsend.com**: To interact with Docsend pages
