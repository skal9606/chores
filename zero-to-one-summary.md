# Zero to One: Key Principles
**Peter Thiel with Blake Masters**

A condensed summary of the essential ideas from the book about building companies that create new things.

---

## Core Thesis: 0 to 1 vs 1 to n

- **Horizontal progress (1 to n)**: Copying things that work, globalization, taking things from one place and making them work everywhere
- **Vertical progress (0 to 1)**: Doing new things, technology, creating something that didn't exist before
- Every moment in business happens only once. The next Bill Gates won't build an operating system—if you're copying, you aren't learning
- Technology is the only way to escape competition in a globalizing world

---

## The Contrarian Question

> "What important truth do very few people agree with you on?"

- Business version: **What valuable company is nobody building?**
- Good answers take the form: "Most people believe X, but the truth is the opposite of X"
- Brilliant thinking is rare, but courage is in even shorter supply than genius
- The most contrarian thing is not to oppose the crowd, but to think for yourself

---

## Monopoly vs Competition

### The Paradox
- Capitalism and competition are opposites
- Under perfect competition, all profits get competed away
- **Monopoly is the condition of every successful business**

### Key Insight
> "All happy companies are different: each one earns a monopoly by solving a unique problem. All failed companies are the same: they failed to escape competition."

### Monopolists vs Competitors
- Monopolists disguise their monopoly (frame market as large)
- Competitors exaggerate their uniqueness (frame market as small)
- The reality is more binary than it appears—most businesses are closer to one extreme

### Why Monopolies Are Good
- Creative monopolists give customers more choices by adding new categories of abundance
- Monopoly profits provide incentive to innovate
- Monopolies can afford to think about things other than survival

---

## The Ideology of Competition

- Competition is an ideology that pervades our society and distorts our thinking
- We're trained from school to compete on the same narrow tracks
- **Competition can make people hallucinate opportunities where none exist**
- Rivalry causes us to overemphasize old opportunities and copy what worked in the past

### Lessons from Conflict
- People fight because they are alike, not different (Shakespeare's insight)
- If you can't beat a rival, it may be better to merge
- Sometimes you do have to fight—if so, strike hard and end it quickly. There is no middle ground.

## Characteristics of Monopoly

To build a durable monopoly, combine these characteristics:

1. **Proprietary Technology**: Must be 10x better than closest substitute
2. **Network Effects**: Product becomes more useful as more people use it
3. **Economies of Scale**: Fixed costs spread over greater sales
4. **Branding**: Strong brand built on substance, not just marketing

### How to Build a Monopoly

1. **Start Small and Monopolize**: Dominate a small market first
2. **Scale Up**: Expand deliberately into related markets
3. **Don't Disrupt**: Avoid competition as much as possible
4. **Be the Last Mover**: Make the last great development and enjoy decades of monopoly profits

## Definite vs Indefinite Thinking

### Four Views of the Future
|                  | **Optimistic**           | **Pessimistic**           |
|------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Definite**     | USA 1950s-1960s         | China today               |
| **Indefinite**   | USA 1982-present        | Europe today              |

### The Problem with Indefinite Thinking
- Process trumps substance
- People prepare for nothing in particular
- Leads to diversification instead of conviction
- Finance, politics, philosophy, and even life have become indefinite

### The Solution
> "A startup is the largest endeavor over which you can have definite mastery. You are not a lottery ticket."

- Long-term planning is undervalued
- Intelligent design beats Darwinian iteration for startups
- A bad plan is better than no plan

---

## The Power Law

- Venture returns follow a power law: a small handful of companies radically outperform all others
- **The best investment in a successful fund equals or outperforms the entire rest of the fund combined**
- Life is not a portfolio—you cannot diversify yourself

### Implications
- Focus relentlessly on something you're good at that will be valuable in the future
- One market will be better than all others
- One distribution strategy usually dominates
- Some moments matter far more than others

## Secrets

### Why Secrets Matter
- Every great business is built around a secret that's hidden from the outside
- Great companies are conspiracies to change the world
- The business version of the contrarian question: what valuable company is nobody building?

### Two Types of Secrets
1. **Secrets of Nature**: Study undiscovered aspects of the physical world
2. **Secrets About People**: What are people not allowed to talk about? What is forbidden?

### Why People Don't Look for Secrets
- Incrementalism: trained to advance in small steps
- Risk aversion: scared of being wrong
- Complacency: social elites believe everything is already known
- Flatness: globalization makes people think someone smarter would have found it

### What to Do with Secrets
- Tell the people you need to, and no more
- The best entrepreneurs know: share your secret with co-conspirators (your company)

---

## Foundations

> "Thiel's Law: A startup messed up at its foundation cannot be fixed."

### Key Decisions
- **Co-founder selection**: Like marriage—share prehistory before starting together
- **Ownership vs Possession vs Control**: Understand the difference and potential conflicts
- **Board size**: Three is ideal, never exceed five (unless public)
- **Full-time commitment**: Everyone should be on the bus or off the bus

### Compensation Philosophy
- The less a startup pays its CEO, the better the company does
- Low CEO pay sets the standard for everyone
- Cash teaches workers to claim value; **equity orients people toward creating future value**
- Anyone who prefers cash to equity reveals a preference for the short term

## Building Your Team (The "Mafia")

### Why Teams Matter
- PayPal Mafia: Elon Musk (SpaceX, Tesla), Reid Hoffman (LinkedIn), YouTube founders, Yelp founders, etc.
- Strong relationships make you more successful in careers beyond the company
- **No company has a culture; every company is a culture**

### Recruiting
- Never outsource recruiting
- Answer: Why should the 20th employee join your company?
- Don't fight the perk war—offer irreplaceable work on a unique problem with great people
- From outside, everyone should be different in the same way (shared mission)
- On the inside, every individual should be distinguished by their work

### One Thing Rule
- Make every person responsible for doing just one thing
- Defining roles reduces conflict
- Internal peace enables survival

---

## Sales and Distribution

> "If you don't see any salespeople, you're the salesperson."

### Why Sales Matters
- Superior distribution alone can create a monopoly
- Poor sales (not bad product) is the most common cause of failure
- **Most businesses get zero distribution channels to work**

### Distribution Methods (by deal size)
1. **Complex Sales** ($1M+): CEO-level relationships, few deals per year
2. **Personal Sales** ($10K-$100K): Sales team, established process
3. **Dead Zone**: Too expensive for personal sales, too narrow for advertising
4. **Marketing/Advertising**: Low-priced products with mass appeal
5. **Viral Marketing**: Product encourages users to invite others

### The Hidden Truth
- Sales works best when hidden
- The best salespeople don't look like salespeople
- Distribution follows a power law—nail one channel perfectly

---

## Humans and Computers

### The Key Insight
> "Computers are complements for humans, not substitutes."

- Computers and humans are good at fundamentally different things
- Gains from working with computers are much higher than gains from trade with other people
- The most valuable companies will ask: **How can computers help humans solve hard problems?**

### Practical Application (PayPal Example)
- Pure automation couldn't stop fraud (thieves adapted)
- Human analysts alone couldn't scale
- Hybrid system: computers flag suspicious transactions, humans make final judgment
- This became Palantir ($1B+ business)

## Seven Questions Every Business Must Answer

1. **Engineering**: Can you create breakthrough technology (10x better)?
2. **Timing**: Is now the right time to start this business?
3. **Monopoly**: Are you starting with a big share of a small market?
4. **People**: Do you have the right team?
5. **Distribution**: Can you deliver your product, not just create it?
6. **Durability**: Will your market position be defensible in 10-20 years?
7. **Secret**: Have you identified a unique opportunity others don't see?

**Get five or six right and you might succeed. Cleantech companies often had zero.**

---

## The Founder's Paradox

- Founders are extreme and contradictory: simultaneously insiders and outsiders
- The most important task in business—creation of new value—cannot be reduced to a formula
- Companies that create new technology often resemble feudal monarchies, not modern organizations
- **A unique founder can make authoritative decisions, inspire loyalty, and plan ahead for decades**

### The Lesson
- We need founders—unusual individuals who lead beyond mere incrementalism
- But don't overestimate your power: founders bring out the best work from everybody
- The greatest danger is becoming so certain of your own myth that you lose your mind

---

## Conclusion: Our Choice

Four possible futures:
1. Recurrent collapse (unlikely—knowledge too widespread)
2. Plateau (globalization, convergence, sameness)
3. Extinction (collapse from competition for scarce resources)
4. **Takeoff (new technology creates much better future)**

The choice is between **nothing** or **something**. We cannot take for granted that the future will be better—**we need to work to create it today**.

> "Our task today is to find singular ways to create the new things that will make the future not just different, but better—to go from 0 to 1. The essential first step is to think for yourself."
